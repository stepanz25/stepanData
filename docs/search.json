It features interactive maps, bar charts, and line plots to visualize the data by country, gender, age group, and time period. The app allows anyone interested in exploring and analyzing suicide rates to study the trends in order to find measures to mitigate the detrimental effects of such phenomena."

It describes my initial excitement for the program, followed by the sudden realization of how challenging it is. It highlights the differences between undergraduate and graduate programs and the difficulty of the workload. In the article, I am recognizing that my experiences may not be as stressful as some of my classmates’ experiences, who are juggling full-time jobs and taking care of their children while studying. The article emphasizes that the purpose of education is not just to learn the course materials but also to train individuals to be motivated problem-solvers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUBC Vancouver Campus"

Hypothesis testing was performed using permutation tests for numerical variables like age and electrocardiography (ECG) results such as maximum heart rate achieved and ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest. The Chi-Squared Test was used for categorical variables in contingency table analysis. Results indicated that heart disease patients have higher average age, lower maximum heart rate achieved, and higher ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest compared to non-heart disease patients. Other factors associated with heart disease include sex, chest pain type, exercise-induced angina, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels, and defect type."
