`forxpy` and `forxr` are Python and R packages that provide easy access to daily exchange rates and forex conversion. They were created by me and my collaborates at UBC and utilize data from the Bank of Canada. The packages support multiple currencies and provide historical exchange rates. Users can easily make currency conversions with a simple function call, and the packages also allow for the retrieval of historical exchange rates in a chart, making it useful for dashboard building. `forxpy` and `forxr` can be useful for various industries that require currency conversions, such as finance and banking, e-commerce, travel and tourism, data analysis, and cryptocurrency. Similar packages include forex-python and CurrencyConverter. `forxpy` and `forxr` are released under the terms of the MIT license and welcome all contributions.
