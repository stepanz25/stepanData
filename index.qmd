# hello there!
:::

I'm Stepan, with my last name pronounced as "zah-YAHTS." I hold both a Master's degree in Data Science and a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Over a span of more than three years, I've garnered valuable experience across a spectrum of chemistry, microbiology, and clinical laboratories. My career aspiration revolves around becoming a proficient data scientist, underlined by a proven ability to generate high-quality analytical data. My skill set encompasses diverse areas, including statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, with a specific focus on applications within the healthcare industry.

Currently, I'm seeking to transition knowledge to the field of computational biology and data science. In my spare time, you'll find me hiking or skiing in the mountains around Vancouver with friends.
