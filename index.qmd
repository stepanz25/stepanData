### hi there! 

I'm Stepan (and my last name is pronounced "zah-YAHTS"). I'm a current Master of Data Science student at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. My professional experience includes over three years of work in various chemistry, microbiology, and clinical laboratories. I am an aspiring data scientist with a track record of producing high-quality analytical data, and leveraging a diverse skill set in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

Currently, I am seeking to transition knowledge to the field of computational biology and data science. In my spare time, you'll typically find me
hiking around Vancouver or skiing in the mountains with friends.
